# Coaster Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about various roller coasters. EDA helps to understand the structure of the data, identify important variables, and detect patterns and relationships that can inform further analysis. 
## Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following columns with data types:
1.coaster_name (object): 
The name of the roller coaster.

2.Location (object): The location where the roller coaster is situated.

 3.Status (object): The operational status of the roller coaster (e.g., operating, closed).

4.Manufacturer (object): The company that manufactured the roller coaster.

 5.year_introduced (int64): The year the roller coaster was introduced.

6.latitude (float64): The latitude coordinate of the roller coaster's location.

 7.longitude (float64): The longitude coordinate of the roller coaster's location.

8.Type_Main (object): The main type or category of the roller coaster (e.g., wooden, steel).

 9.opening_date_clean (datetime64[ns]): The cleaned and formatted opening date of the roller coaster.

 10.speed_mph (float64): The top speed of the roller coaster in miles per hour.

11.height_ft (float64): The height of the roller coaster in feet.

 12.Inversions_clean (int64): The number of inversions (loops) on the roller coaster.

 13.Gforce_clean (float64): The G-force experienced on the roller coaster.

## Steps involves
